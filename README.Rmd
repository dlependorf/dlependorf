# This dataset consists of about a million and a half pitches from 2008-2017, as captured by PITCHf/x. None of these
# pitches were seen by the model during training. The model uses the XGBoost algorithm, and the XGBoost raw scores are
# in the "prediction" column. These scores were then fed into a logistic regression scaling model to bring the infield
# flyball predicted scores in line with how often infield flyballs actually occur. This score is in the
# "calibrated_prediction" column. Pitch locations were normalized for strike zone dimensions so all pitch locations are
# given in coordinates where the strike zone is the square from -1 to 1 in both axes. Additionally, all pitch locations
# were mirrored if needed so the data always represents a pitch thrown from a right-handed pitcher.

Hey there. I'm Dan Lependorf, and I'm a Sr. Data Scientist at [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/). I used to work as a baseball analyst, hence the plot above. I'll put side projects and any other fun non-work stuff here.

The code used to generate the plot above is in the R Markdown file in this repo.
