![A fun plot of predicted infield flyball
probabilities.](https://github.com/dlependorf/dlependorf/blob/master/iffb_location_plot.png?raw=true)
Hey there. I’m Dan Lependorf, and I run the data science team at [The
Athletic](https://theathletic.com/). I’ll put side projects and any
other fun non-work stuff here.

The code used to generate the plot above (and this text!) is in the R
Markdown file in this repo
[here](https://github.com/dlependorf/dlependorf/blob/master/README.Rmd).
