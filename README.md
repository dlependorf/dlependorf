![A fun plot of predicted infield flyball
probabilities.](https://github.com/dlependorf/dlependorf/blob/master/iffb_location_plot.png?raw=true)
Hey there. I’m Dan Lependorf, and I’m a Sr. Data Scientist at [The
Athletic](https://theathletic.com/). I used to work as a baseball
analyst, hence the plot above. I’ll put side projects and any other fun
non-work stuff here.

The code used to generate the plot above is in the R Markdown file in
this repo
[here](https://github.com/dlependorf/dlependorf/blob/master/README.Rmd).
